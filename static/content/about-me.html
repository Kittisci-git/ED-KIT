  Hi! I’m Cmdr Kittisci, welcome to ED:KIT!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I started my journey in Elite Dangerous in August 2016 as a humble trader, chasing profits across the bubble and eventually reaching Elite V in Trade (I was buried in promotions when Odyssey launched). Since then I’ve explored the galaxy, visiting Colonia, Sagittarius A*, and a whole load of empty systems. I made it back to the bubble just in time for Trailblazers to drop and have gone all-in as a System Architect!
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Outside the cockpit, I have an academic background in astrophysics and work as physics teacher. I enjoy helping people—whether that’s helping new players learn how to navigate the galactic map or giving veteran commanders a better way to visualise their dream colonies among the stars. I'm also a proud member of First Steps Academy, a squadron dedicated to helping new and returning commanders find their feet in the black.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I sincerely hope that you enjoy using ED:KIT as much as I've enjoyed building it.
</p>
<p> 
  o7, Commander Kittisci
