<h2>About ED:KIT</h2>

  The site was created by Cmdr Kittisci, a long-time player with a deep interest in colony-building and system development. What began as a set of personal tools for managing a long-term colonisation effort gradually evolved into a fully-fledged planner designed to be shared. ED:KIT is built with for commanders who enjoy the creative process of system planning and want a clear way to visualise and control every aspect of their projects.

  While the Colony Planner is the first tool available, ED:KIT is intended to grow. Throughout development, the guiding principle has been simple: to support the Elite Dangerous community by providing thoughtful, usable tools that make deep gameplay more accessible and satisfying.
